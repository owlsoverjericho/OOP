#Pizzeria offers pizza-of-the-day for business lunch. 
#The type of pizza-of-the-day depends on the day of week. 
#Having a pizza-of-the-day simplifies ordering for customers. 
#They don't have to be experts on specific types of pizza. 
#Also, customers can add extra ingredients to the pizza-of-the-day. 
#Write a program that will form orders from customers.
